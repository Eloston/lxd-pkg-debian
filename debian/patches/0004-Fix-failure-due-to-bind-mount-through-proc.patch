Subject: Fix failure due to bind-mount through /proc
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The kernel won't allow us to bind-mount stuff through /proc.
Since the main reason for my previous change was to fix /dev handling,
lets just whitelist /dev as safe to read from within the snap, which
should be fine so long as distros use devtmpfs.

Closes #3968
